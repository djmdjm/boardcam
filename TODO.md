# TODO list

* Main: Support DXF output (using [ezdxf](https://pypi.org/project/ezdxf/))
* Main: Better board outline detection. Currently a pile of messy heuristics
* Gcode: Remove eurorack assumptions by default (make it a flag)
* Gcode: Support different drilling cycles (e.g. simple feed, G83)
* GCode: support work coordinate offsets other than G53
* GCode: better inter-component toolpaths (approx travelling salesman solver)
* Gcode: relax (too conservative) entry drill size requirements for slotted holes
* Fix all the bugs
